Rowling wrote such companion volumes as Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them (2001) and cowrote a story on which the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (2016) was based. Her adult fiction includes The Casual Vacancy (2012) and the Cormoran Strike series (as Robert Galbraith).J.K. Rowling started writing about Harry Potter after graduating from the University of Exeter. After a brief marriage and the birth of her daughter, Rowling settled in Edinburgh and lived on public assistance between stints as a French teacher and writing. After many rejections, Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone was published to immediate success.</p><h2>Why JK Rowling is an inspiration?</h2><p>JK Rowling is an inspirational writer because she encourages children, creates a strong role model for women, and shares her imagination and generosity with growing teens and charities.</p>
